This project will be an itinerary builder/manager

The main goal is to easily be able to build/save POIs and map between them

Users should also be able to save multiple itineraries and modify them

I would like to utilize Google Maps API for distance/time to travel calculations

General things that need to be built:

- Itinerary

- Day

- Point

- Route Info



Home Page: 

Select an Itinerary
Create a new Itinerary

Select start Date

Select end Date


View Itinerary:

Dates.

View Date: 

Points and Routes

Point View

Route View?

Itineraries will have many Days, Days will have many Points, two Points will share a Route

Itinerary: 
    - name
    - description
    - Days = []

Day:
     - description
     - Points = []
     - Routes = []

Point:
    - name
    - type
    - description
    - info

Route:
    - distance
    - time
    - method


should probably isolate the points or dates by their parent ID outside of the component to reduce logic in the show component
